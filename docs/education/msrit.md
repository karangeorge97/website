## Exploring Passions

During my undergraduate studies, I used the freedom and resources available at MSRIT to explore various areas of computer science and find my true calling. I actively participated in extracurricular activities, joined tech clubs, and engaged in projects that allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios.

It was during this time that I discovered my passion for using technology for social good. Through my involvement in projects aimed at creating positive social impact, I realized the immense potential of technology to address social challenges and make a difference in people's lives.

This realization shaped my future aspirations and led me to pursue further education in computer science with a focus on leveraging technology for social good.
